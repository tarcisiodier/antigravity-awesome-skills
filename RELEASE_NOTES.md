## 📦 Improvements

- **Unified Catalog**: A new auto-generated `CATALOG.md` replaces the static registry, ensuring documentation never drifts from reality.
- **Legacy Cleanup**: Removed the bulky 250+ row table from `README.md` for better load times and readability.
- **Automation**: Introduced `scripts/build-catalog.js` to automatically maintain the skill index.
- **Documentation**: Restructured `README.md` to focus on high-level domains rather than a flat list.

## 👥 Credits

A huge shoutout to our community contributors:

- **@rmyndharis** for the massive contribution of 300+ Enterprise skills and the catalog generation logic.
